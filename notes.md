# Notes

# PHP and MySQL

* To connect to a MySQL database we'll use a PDO object
* The PDO object will need a DSN
    * Data Source Name-> driver, host, database name
* I will also need the username and the password.
* We'll prefer to use exceptions
    * Try - catch
    * We don't fully control MySQL
* Database credentials should be ALWAYS excluded from git
    * That's the reason why we have a constants.php file



## Similarities

Tables / Result Set  -> Arrays -> bi-dimensional
Columns              -> keys in an associative array
Rows                 -> item in an array
